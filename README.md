# Voice-Assistant-using-Python
This project is a basic voice assistant built using Python. It can perform various tasks such as opening websites, telling the current time, searching the web, and responding to voice commands. The assistant uses speech recognition and text-to-speech libraries to interact with the user in a natural and hands-free way.
